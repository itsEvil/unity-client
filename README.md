# unity-client

A client made in unity to connect to my vanilla-7.0 source

### Status - Work in Progress 

# Notes 

Currently it doesn't do anything as I am still working on the backend. 
But this will be another alternative client for my vanilla-7.0 server source.  

### Requirements

- Unity version 2022.3.11f1
- Any C# Code Editor (Visual Studio/Code, Rider etc)
